# Methodology: Airline Network Analysis using Johnson's Algorithm

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the methodology employed in analyzing airline route networks using Johnson's algorithm for shortest path computation. The approach combines graph theory, geographic information systems, and algorithmic optimization to identify codeshare opportunities and optimize route planning in the aviation industry.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

### Airport Data Sources

The foundation of our analysis relies on accurate and comprehensive airport data. We utilize the Global Airport Database, which provides standardized information for over 10,000 airports worldwide. This database includes essential attributes such as IATA codes, ICAO codes, geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), airport names, cities, and countries.

The data preprocessing phase involves several critical steps to ensure data quality and consistency. First, we filter the global database to include only airports that are actively served by the airlines under analysis. This filtering process reduces computational complexity while maintaining analytical relevance. Second, we validate geographic coordinates by checking for reasonable latitude and longitude ranges and identifying potential outliers that might indicate data entry errors.

### Route Network Construction

Airline route networks are constructed by analyzing official airline schedules, route maps, and operational data. For this analysis, we focus on two major Brazilian carriers: Gol Linhas Aéreas and Azul Linhas Aéreas. These airlines were selected due to their complementary network structures, with Gol focusing primarily on international destinations and major domestic hubs, while Azul emphasizes connectivity to smaller cities and regional airports throughout Brazil.

The route construction process involves identifying hub airports for each carrier and modeling their spoke-and-hub network architectures. Hub identification is based on multiple factors including flight frequency, passenger volume, and strategic importance to the airline's network. For Gol, primary hubs include São Paulo-Guarulhos (GRU), São Paulo-Congonhas (CGH), and Viracopos-Campinas (VCP). Azul's network centers around Viracopos-Campinas (VCP) as its primary hub, with secondary hubs in Belo Horizonte-Confins (CNF) and Brasília (BSB).

## Graph Theory Foundation

### Network Representation

Airline route networks are naturally represented as directed weighted graphs, where vertices correspond to airports and edges represent flight routes. This mathematical abstraction allows us to apply sophisticated algorithmic techniques to solve complex routing problems. In our representation, each vertex contains metadata including airport codes, geographic coordinates, city and country information, and operational characteristics.

Edge weights in our model represent the great-circle distance between airports, calculated using the Haversine formula. This approach provides a realistic approximation of flight distances while maintaining computational efficiency. The Haversine formula accounts for the Earth's spherical geometry and calculates the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere.

### Multi-Airline Network Integration

A key innovation in our approach is the construction of a unified graph that represents multiple airline networks simultaneously. This integration allows us to model codeshare scenarios where passengers can seamlessly transfer between different carriers to reach their destinations. Each edge in the combined graph includes metadata indicating which airlines operate that particular route, enabling the identification of routes that require cooperation between carriers.

The integration process involves careful consideration of hub connectivity and transfer possibilities. We model realistic transfer scenarios by connecting airports where both airlines operate, while maintaining separate route segments for airline-specific operations. This approach creates a comprehensive network that captures both competitive and cooperative aspects of the airline industry.

## Johnson's Algorithm Implementation

### Algorithm Overview

Johnson's algorithm represents the state-of-the-art approach for solving the all-pairs shortest path problem in directed graphs with arbitrary edge weights. The algorithm is particularly well-suited for airline network analysis because it efficiently handles large networks while providing optimal solutions for all possible origin-destination pairs.

The algorithm operates in three distinct phases, each serving a specific purpose in the overall optimization process. The first phase employs the Bellman-Ford algorithm to detect negative cycles and compute reweighting values. The second phase transforms the original graph by reweighting edges to ensure non-negative weights. The third phase applies Dijkstra's algorithm to compute shortest paths in the reweighted graph.

### Phase 1: Bellman-Ford and Negative Cycle Detection

The initial phase of Johnson's algorithm introduces an auxiliary vertex connected to all original vertices with zero-weight edges. This construction enables the Bellman-Ford algorithm to compute shortest path distances from the auxiliary vertex to all other vertices in the graph. These distances serve as reweighting values that will be used to transform the original graph.

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is particularly important in this context because it can detect negative cycles, which would indicate inconsistencies in the route network model. In airline networks, negative cycles are typically not expected, but their detection provides a valuable validation mechanism for data quality and model correctness.

### Phase 2: Graph Reweighting

The reweighting phase transforms the original graph to ensure that all edge weights become non-negative, which is a prerequisite for applying Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently. For each edge (u,v) with original weight w(u,v), the new weight is calculated as w'(u,v) = w(u,v) + h(u) - h(v), where h(u) and h(v) are the reweighting values computed in the first phase.

This transformation preserves the shortest path structure of the original graph while enabling the use of more efficient algorithms in subsequent phases. The mathematical properties of this reweighting ensure that shortest paths in the transformed graph correspond exactly to shortest paths in the original graph.

### Phase 3: All-Pairs Dijkstra

The final phase applies Dijkstra's algorithm from each vertex in the reweighted graph to compute shortest paths to all other vertices. Dijkstra's algorithm is optimal for this purpose because it efficiently handles non-negative edge weights and provides both distance and path information.

After computing shortest paths in the reweighted graph, the algorithm corrects the distances back to the original graph by applying the inverse transformation: d(u,v) = d'(u,v) + h(v) - h(u), where d'(u,v) is the distance in the reweighted graph and d(u,v) is the corrected distance in the original graph.

## Codeshare Opportunity Analysis

### Definition and Identification

Codeshare opportunities represent scenarios where the optimal route between two airports requires the use of multiple airlines. These opportunities arise when one airline provides superior connectivity to the origin airport while another airline offers better access to the destination airport. The identification of such opportunities requires sophisticated analysis of the combined network structure.

Our methodology defines a codeshare opportunity as a shortest path that includes route segments operated by different airlines. The analysis examines each shortest path to determine which airline operates each segment, flagging routes where passengers would benefit from seamless transfers between partner airlines.

### Opportunity Classification

We classify codeshare opportunities into several categories based on their characteristics and strategic value. The primary classification distinguishes between domestic and international opportunities, as these require different regulatory considerations and market strategies. International opportunities often provide higher revenue potential but involve more complex operational coordination.

Secondary classifications consider factors such as route distance, number of intermediate stops, and the specific airlines involved. Short-haul opportunities with minimal stops are generally more attractive to passengers and easier to implement operationally. Long-haul opportunities may provide greater strategic value but require more sophisticated coordination mechanisms.

### Strategic Value Assessment

The strategic value of codeshare opportunities is assessed using multiple criteria including route efficiency, market potential, and operational feasibility. Route efficiency is measured by comparing the codeshare route distance to alternative routing options. Market potential considers factors such as passenger demand, competitive landscape, and revenue opportunities.

Operational feasibility assessment examines practical considerations such as schedule coordination, baggage handling, and passenger transfer procedures. Opportunities that require minimal operational changes are prioritized for implementation, while more complex opportunities may require longer-term strategic planning.

## Geographic Analysis and Visualization

### Spatial Data Integration

The integration of geographic information systems (GIS) capabilities enhances the analytical power of our approach by providing spatial context for network analysis results. Airport coordinates enable the calculation of accurate distances and the creation of geographically accurate visualizations that facilitate interpretation and communication of results.

Spatial analysis reveals important patterns in airline network structure, such as the geographic distribution of hubs, the orientation of major route corridors, and the coverage gaps that might represent expansion opportunities. These insights complement the algorithmic analysis by providing intuitive understanding of network characteristics.

### Visualization Techniques

We employ multiple visualization techniques to communicate analysis results effectively to different audiences. Geographic maps show the spatial distribution of airports and routes, providing immediate visual understanding of network coverage and connectivity patterns. Network diagrams emphasize the topological structure of the airline network, highlighting hub-and-spoke patterns and connectivity relationships.

Statistical visualizations present quantitative analysis results in accessible formats, including histograms of route distances, bar charts of opportunity distributions, and scatter plots of efficiency metrics. These visualizations enable stakeholders to quickly identify key insights and make informed decisions based on the analysis results.

## Validation and Quality Assurance

### Algorithm Verification

The correctness of our Johnson's algorithm implementation is verified through multiple approaches including comparison with known optimal solutions, consistency checks across different algorithm variants, and validation against established benchmarks. We implement comprehensive unit tests that verify each phase of the algorithm independently and integration tests that validate the complete workflow.

Performance validation ensures that the algorithm scales appropriately with network size and maintains acceptable computational efficiency for practical applications. We benchmark our implementation against standard graph algorithm libraries to ensure competitive performance characteristics.

### Data Quality Assessment

Data quality assessment involves systematic validation of input data including airport coordinates, route information, and airline operational data. We implement automated checks for common data quality issues such as duplicate entries, missing values, and inconsistent formatting.

Geographic validation verifies that airport coordinates correspond to reasonable locations and that calculated distances align with known flight distances. Route validation ensures that modeled connections reflect actual airline operations and that hub assignments accurately represent airline network strategies.

## Computational Complexity and Scalability

### Theoretical Analysis

Johnson's algorithm has a time complexity of O(V²log V + VE), where V is the number of vertices (airports) and E is the number of edges (routes). This complexity makes the algorithm practical for airline networks of realistic size, which typically involve hundreds to thousands of airports.

The space complexity is O(V²) for storing the distance and path matrices, which represents a reasonable memory requirement for modern computing systems. The algorithm's complexity characteristics make it suitable for both batch analysis and interactive applications.

### Practical Performance Considerations

In practice, airline networks exhibit sparse connectivity patterns that can be exploited to improve computational efficiency. Most airports connect to only a small fraction of all possible destinations, resulting in sparse adjacency matrices that can be processed more efficiently than dense networks.

We implement several optimization techniques including early termination conditions, memory-efficient data structures, and parallel processing capabilities where appropriate. These optimizations enable the analysis of large-scale airline networks within reasonable computational timeframes.

## Applications and Extensions

### Strategic Planning Applications

The methodology provides valuable insights for airline strategic planning including route optimization, hub location decisions, and partnership evaluation. Airlines can use the analysis results to identify underserved markets, optimize their network structure, and evaluate potential codeshare agreements.

The quantitative nature of the analysis enables data-driven decision making and provides objective criteria for comparing different strategic alternatives. This capability is particularly valuable in the highly competitive airline industry where operational efficiency directly impacts profitability.

### Research Applications

The methodology contributes to academic research in several domains including operations research, transportation science, and network analysis. The combination of theoretical algorithmic techniques with practical industry applications provides a rich foundation for further research and development.

Potential research extensions include the incorporation of dynamic factors such as seasonal demand variations, the analysis of multi-modal transportation networks, and the development of real-time optimization algorithms for operational decision making.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

The current methodology focuses primarily on distance-based optimization and does not fully incorporate other important factors such as flight schedules, aircraft capacity constraints, and passenger preferences. These factors could significantly impact the practical implementation of identified opportunities.

The analysis assumes perfect coordination between airlines in codeshare scenarios, which may not reflect real-world operational constraints and competitive dynamics. Future work should incorporate more realistic models of inter-airline cooperation and competition.

### Future Research Directions

Future research directions include the development of multi-objective optimization approaches that consider multiple criteria simultaneously, the incorporation of uncertainty and risk factors into the analysis, and the extension to dynamic network analysis that accounts for temporal variations in demand and capacity.

The integration of machine learning techniques could enhance the predictive capabilities of the methodology and enable more sophisticated pattern recognition in airline network data. These advances would further increase the practical value of the analysis for industry applications.
